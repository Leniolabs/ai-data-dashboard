# AI Dashboard Generator

AI Dashboard Generator is an open-source dashboard generator based on Next.js and OpenAI's GPT3 technology. The tool allows users to feed existing tables or datasets, and from there, it understands the intent of the table and generates a visual representation of the data.

It utilizes a prompt engineered to make the AI reply using JSON to create simple and useful visualizations. You do not need to add any requirements for the titles or content, as the AI does it all by using the data you provide. You can upload your data in CSV files and then easily visualize your data and gain valuable insights into your business or organization.
